### Hello there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Julien A. Raemy
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julsraemy/julsraemy/main/Cultural_heritage%2C_Digital_humanities%2C_stuff.png)

I currently work as a Data Scientist at the [Swiss Federal Archives](https://www.bar.admin.ch) and I am quite active in the [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io) (IIIF) as well as in the [Linked Art](https://linked.art) community.

Originally trained as a bookseller, I then studied Information Science at the HES-SO University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Western Switzerland, Haute Ã©cole de gestion de GenÃ¨ve (BSc and MSc), before earning a PhD in Digital Humanities from the University of Basel.

I am particularly interested in ways of improving the digital preservation, dissemination and interoperability of cultural heritage objects and their associated metadata through the application of standards that adhere to the Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) design principles. I also investigate digital practices from the perspective of Science and Technology Studies (STS), especially through the lens of the Actor-Network Theory (ANT).

Skills: Data Modelling, Digital Archives, IIIF, Linked Data

- ðŸ”­ I have just defended my PhD thesis - which will be soon published: [Linked Open Usable Data for Cultural Heritage: Perspectives on Community Practices and Semantic Interoperability](https://phd.julsraemy.ch)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to improve on my German language skills
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him (cf. https://name.pn/julien-antoine-raemy)
