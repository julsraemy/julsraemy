### Hello there 👋, my name is Julien A. Raemy
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julsraemy/julsraemy/main/Cultural_heritage%2C_Digital_humanities%2C_stuff.png)

_Originally trained as a bookseller, I then studied Information Science in Geneva (Bachelor and Master) and am now a PhD Candidate in Digital Humanities at the University of Basel._

I am particularly interested in ways of improving the digital preservation, dissemination and interoperability of cultural heritage objects and their associated metadata through the application of Linked Open Data. I am quite active in the International Image Interoperability Framework ([IIIF](https://iiif.io)) where I am a member of the IIIF Technical Review Committe (TRC).

Since February 2021, I have embarked on a PhD in Digital Humanities at the University of Basel, Digital Humanities Lab in the context of the interdisciplinary research project “Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archive” (PIA) which is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF). Simultaneously, I have also started working as an Interoperability and Metadata Consultant at the DaSCH, Swiss National Data & Service Center for the Humanities.

Skills: Data Modelling, IIIF, Linked Open Data

- 🔭 I’m currently working on on my PhD which has the current working title: _"Deploying a Citizen Humanities infrastructure with Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) standards: perspectives on Interoperability and Knowledge Representation”_
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to improve on my German language skills
