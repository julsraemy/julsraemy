### Hello there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Julien A. Raemy
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julsraemy/julsraemy/main/Cultural_heritage%2C_Digital_humanities%2C_stuff.png)

I currently work as a Data Scientist at the [Swiss Federal Archives](https://www.bar.admin.ch) and as an Interoperability Specialist at [DaSCH, Swiss National Data and Service Center for the Humanities](https://www.dasch.swiss). I have played a key role in the [Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives](https://about.participatory-archives.ch) (PIA) research project, focusing on extending the data infrastructure, advocating the adoption of the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) and designing the data model. Previously, between February 2021 and March 2024, I was actively involved in the PIA project. I am presently finalising my PhD thesis on Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) for Cultural Heritage, which is closely related to the activities I carried out for PIA.

I am quite active in the [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io) (IIIF) as well as in the [Linked Art](https://linked.art) community.

I am particularly interested in ways of improving the digital preservation, dissemination and interoperability of cultural heritage objects and their associated metadata through the application of Linked Open Data. I also investigate digital practices from the perspective of Science and Technology Studies (STS), especially through the lens of the Actor-Network Theory (ANT).

Skills: Data Modelling, IIIF, Linked Open Data
