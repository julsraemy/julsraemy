### Hello there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Julien A. Raemy
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julsraemy/julsraemy/main/Cultural_heritage%2C_Digital_humanities%2C_stuff.png)

_Originally trained as a bookseller, I then studied Information Science in Geneva (Bachelor and Master) and am now a PhD Candidate in Digital Humanities at the University of Basel._

Since February 2021, I have embarked on a PhD in Digital Humanities at the University of Basel, Digital Humanities Lab in the context of the interdisciplinary research project [Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives](https://about.participatory-archives.ch) (PIA) which is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF). Simultaneously, I have also started working as an Interoperability and Metadata Consultant at DaSCH, Swiss National Data & Service Center for the Humanities. 

I am quite active in the [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io) (IIIF) where I am a member of the IIIF Technical Review Committe (TRC).

I am particularly interested in ways of improving the digital preservation, dissemination and interoperability of cultural heritage objects and their associated metadata through the application of Linked Open Data. I also investigate digital practices from the perspective of Science and Technology Studies (STS), especially through the lens of the Actor-Network Theory (ANT).

Skills: Data Modelling, IIIF, Linked Open Data
